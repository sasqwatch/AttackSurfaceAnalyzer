# Attack Surface Analyzer 

## Version 2.1

Attack Surface Analyzer was first released for the general audience starting in version 2.0 (see [Release\v2.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/AttackSurfaceAnalyzer/tree/release/v2.0)).  The master branch tracks continuing development and is inappropriate for production use. To obtain the latest official release, click [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/AttackSurfaceAnalyzer/releases/latest).

## Overview

Attack Surface Analyzer is a Microsoft-developed open source security tool that analyzes the attack 
surface of a target system and reports on potential security vulnerabilities introduced during
the installation of software or system misconfiguration. 

Attack Surface Analyzer 2.0 replaces the original [Attack Surface Analyzer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24487) tool, released publicly in 2012.

Potential users of Attack Surface Analyzer include:

* DevOps Engineers - View changes to the system attack surface introduced when your software is installed.
* IT Security Auditors - Evaluate risk presented by when third-party software is installed.

## Core Features

The core feature of Attack Surface Analyzer is the ability to "diff" an operating system's security configuration, 
before and after a software component is installed. This is important because most installation processes require
elevated privileges, and once granted, can lead to unintended system configuration changes.

Attack Surface Analyzer currently reports on changes to the following operating system components:

- File system (static snapshot and live monitoring available)
- User accounts
- Services
- Network Ports
- Certificates
- Registry (Windows only)

All data collected is stored in a local SQLite database called `asa.sqlite`.

## How to Use Attack Surface Analyzer

Information on how to use Attack Surface Analyzer can be found on our
[wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/AttackSurfaceAnalyzer/wiki).

## Future Plans (tentative)

We plan on adding additional features to Attack Surface Analyzer, including those from the list below: 

- Code signing info
- Drivers (partially covered presently via file system monitoring)
- Firewall settings
- Redistributable installations
- Network traffic (live monitoring)
- Registry (live monitoring)
- Requested features which existed in the original Attack Surface Analyzer.

If you have feedback on these or other features, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/AttackSurfaceAnalyzer/issues).
